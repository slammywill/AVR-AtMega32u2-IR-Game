# GAME DESCRIPTION
This is a game where arrows (represented by dots) fall from the top of the screen. The objective of the game is to press the corresponding input on the navswitch when the arrow is on the bottom row of the screeen. There are 5 columns, and the navswitch inputs from the leftmost column to right are as follows: WEST, NORTH, MIDDLE, SOUTH, EAST. If you miss three arrows in a row, you lose the game. To win the game, you must get 50 points, where each point is given by using the correct input at the right time when the arrow is at the bottom of the screeen.

With IR capability, the two players race to get to fifty points, although they can still lose by missing three inputs in a row. When a player loses, they will go to the lose screen and the other player will see the win screen. Additionally, when a player gets 3 correct in a row, the blue led lights up and they will be able to press button 1 to slightly speed up the opponents arrow speed, making it harder for them.
